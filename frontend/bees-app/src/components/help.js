Lifeofbees gives you the opportunity to explore the world of beekeeping and take part in the main activities of an apiary.
You can create games in private mode, where only you can view and access the game, or in public mode, where the game can be viewed and accessed by all visitors of the page.
On the main page, you can see all public games created by other users under the Public Game tab, or only your private games under the Private Game tab.
To create private games, you need to log in using the registration form, where you can create an account with a username and password, or sign in with your Gmail account.
The next step is to create your own game using the New Game form, where you'll need to choose a name for your game, a UK location, how many years the game should last, and how many hives you willll start with ‚Äî with a maximum of 5 hives.
After completing all these steps, you will enter the world of beekeeping.
The game automatically generates the hives with a random number of honey frames (used for honey harvested) and egg frames (used by the queen to lay eggs).
Each hive can have up to 12 frames, divided almost equally between honey and egg frames.
The age of the queen is randomly generated, with a maximum age of 5 years. When this age is reached, the old queen is replaced with a new one aged 0 years.
Each year, you have the opportunity to increase the number of hives by purchasing new ones ‚Äî but only during the months of March and April.
Hives can also be split, and for this reason, we have defined the parameter "Was Split" for each hive.
Bee life and the activities in the apiary heavily depend on the weather conditions. That is why you can always see temperature, precipitation, and wind speed displayed on the right side of the screen.
Weather data is provided by specialized websites for the selected UK location.
At the beginning of each game, every player receives ¬£3000, which can be used to buy new hives or pay for bee treatments.
The treatment cost is ¬£10 per hive.
During each beekeeping season, different types of honey are harvested depending on the local flora. A photo of the collected flower is displayed in the right column, along with the amount of honey collected so far.
You can sell honey and receive money, which can be used to buy hives the following year or pay for bee treatments.
If you want to view the action history of a specific hive, simply click on that hive. A new page will open where you'll find the hive's history from the beginning of the game.
To view the overall apiary history, press the Game History button.
To begin the game, you need to press the Iterate one week button.
In real life, every beekeeper keeps a notebook where they write down all actions performed for each hive throughout the beekeeping season.
These actions may include simply checking for the queen's presence and the health of the bees, adding a frame for egg-laying or for honey harvesting.
The beekeeper harvests honey and performs treatments to maintain the health of the hive.
They also decide whether to split a hive once it reaches maturity. After splitting a hive into two new hives, they can choose to support the new colonies with egg frames from other hives.
Only one egg frame can be taken from a hive to help another.
In the game, we have included only the most important actions from beekeeping activities.
Good luck! üêù
