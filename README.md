This game is built with Java 23, Spring Boot, and MongoDB for the backend,
while the frontend uses React and Bootstrap.
I used Google OAuth2 and JWT for authentication and authorization.
I connected the LifeOfBees application to the Weather API using Spring’s RestTemplate.

The live version of this game is available at [lifeofbees.co.uk](https://lifeofbees.co.uk).
